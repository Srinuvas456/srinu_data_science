    "Grid search cross-validation (GridSearchCV) is a hyperparameter tuning technique used in machine learning. Its main purpose is to exhaustively search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model to achieve the best possible performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, hyperparameters are model parameters that are set before the training process begins and are not learned during training. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, regularization parameter, maximum depth of decision trees, etc. The selection of appropriate hyperparameters is crucial in achieving good model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV works by performing an exhaustive search over a specified range of hyperparameter values, which are defined by the user. The algorithm then evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters using cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique that involves splitting the data into training and validation sets, training the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the validation set. This process is repeated multiple times with different splits, and the average performance score is used as a metric to evaluate the model.\n",

    "Grid search cv and randomized search cv are two popular techniques for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. Both methods involve searching over a range of hyperparameters, but they differ in their approach to exploring the hyperparameter space.\n",

    "Grid Search CV:\n",
    "Grid search cv involves defining a grid of hyperparameters and performing an exhaustive search over all possible combinations of these hyperparameters. This means that it evaluates all possible hyperparameter combinations, which can be computationally expensive when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters. However, grid search guarantees that the optimal set of hyperparameters will be found within the specified search space.\n",

This method randomly selects hyperparameters to evaluate, and it can be more computationally efficient than grid search. However, it does not guarantee that the optimal set of hyperparameters will be found, and it may require more iterations to converge to the best set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search cv is a good choice when the number of hyperparameters is small and the search space is not too large. This is because grid search guarantees that the optimal set of hyperparameters will be found within the search space.

In other words, the model learns something from the testing or validation data that it should not have, and this can lead to unrealistic performance estimates. Data leakage is a significant problem in machine learning because it can cause a model to appear to perform better than it actually does, leading to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data.\n",

    "Suppose you are working on a credit card fraud detection system, and you have a dataset with two columns: \"transaction amount\" and \"fraudulent or not\" label.

You notice that there is a strong correlation between the transaction amount and the fraudulent label: fraudulent transactions tend to have larger transaction amounts.\n",
