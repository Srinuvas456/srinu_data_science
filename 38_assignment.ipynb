The degrees of freedom for the numerator is n1-1 and for the denominator is n2-1, where n1 and n2 are the sample sizes.\n",

    "where yi is the ith observation, ȳ is the sample mean, and Σ is the sum of all observations.\n",

    "Since we do not have the actual observations, we cannot calculate the sample variances. However, we can use the fact that the ratio of the sample variances follows an F-distribution.\n",
