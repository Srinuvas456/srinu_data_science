    "1) Mean : The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset and is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency because it takes into account all the values in the dataset. However, the mean is sensitive to outliers, which can skew the results\n",

    "3) Mode : The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency for categorical or discrete data. In some cases, a dataset may have multiple modes\n",
    "4) Range : The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. The range provides a measure of variability by indicating the spread of the data. However, the range is sensitive to outliers and may not be a robust measure of variability\n",
    "5) Standard deviation : The standard deviation is a measure of variability that indicates how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean. The standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. The standard deviation is a useful measure of variability because it is sensitive to outliers and provides a measure of how tightly the data is clustered around the mean\n"
