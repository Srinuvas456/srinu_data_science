    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination.\n",

    "In a linear regression model, the R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that none of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s), while a value of 1 indicates that all of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated by dividing the explained variance by the total variance. The explained variance is the sum of squares of the difference between the predicted value and the mean of the dependent variable, while the total variance is the sum of squares of the difference between the observed value and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",

    "R-squared values are useful in evaluating the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. A higher R-squared value indicates that the model fits the data better, while a lower R-squared value indicates that the model does not fit the data well. However, it is important to note that a high R-squared value does not necessarily mean that the model is a good predictor of the dependent variable, as it may still be overfitting the data. Therefore, it is important to also consider other factors such as the residual plots, significance of the coefficients, and other model selection criteria when evaluating a linear regression model"
