    "An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method that combines the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance. The idea behind ensemble techniques is that by combining the predictions of multiple models, the strengths of each individual model can be exploited while mitigating their weaknesses. Ensemble techniques are widely used in machine learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of models.\n",

    "There are several different types of ensemble techniques, including:\n",

    "1) Bagging: In bagging, multiple models are trained independently on different subsets of the training data. The final prediction is then made by aggregating the predictions of all the models.\n",
