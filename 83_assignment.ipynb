The main purpose of a confusion matrix is to help assess the accuracy of a model by comparing the predicted and actual labels for each class.\n",

Similarly, if a model has a high number of false negatives for a particular class, this could indicate that the model is underestimating the presence of that class in the data. By analyzing the patterns in the confusion matrix, machine learning practitioners can identify which classes the model is struggling to correctly classify and adjust the model parameters or data preprocessing accordingly."

    "Accuracy is a commonly used evaluation metric for classification tasks that measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances. However, there are some limitations of using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Imbalanced datasets: Accuracy can be misleading when the dataset is imbalanced, i.e., when there are more instances of one class than the others. In such cases, a model that always predicts the majority class can achieve a high accuracy but may not be useful in practice. To address this, other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Misclassification costs: Different misclassification errors may have different costs in real-world applications. For example, in medical diagnosis, a false negative may be more costly than a false positive. In such cases, using accuracy as the sole evaluation metric may not be appropriate. Instead, other evaluation metrics that consider the misclassification costs, such as weighted accuracy or cost-sensitive evaluation metrics, can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Multi-class classification: In multi-class classification, accuracy may not provide enough information on the performance of the model for each class. In such cases, using other evaluation metrics such as macro-averaged or micro-averaged precision, recall, or F1-score can provide more insights.\n",
    "\n",
