    "Python's multiprocessing module provides a convenient way to create and manage multiple processes within a Python program. Each process has its own memory space and runs independently, allowing them to execute in parallel and avoid blocking each other. These processes can communicate with each other using various inter-process communication mechanisms, such as pipes, queues, and shared memory\n"
