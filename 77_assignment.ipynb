    "In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a projection refers to the process of mapping data points from their original high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space, defined by a subset of principal components (PCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In PCA, the goal is to find a set of orthogonal directions or axes (i.e., the principal components) that capture the most variation in the data. The first principal component is the direction that explains the maximum amount of variance in the data, and each subsequent principal component explains the maximum amount of remaining variance that is orthogonal to the previous components.\n",
    "\n",
    "To project the data onto a subset of principal components, the original data points are projected onto the principal axes. Specifically, each data point is mapped onto the low-dimensional space defined by the selected principal components, by taking a dot product of the data point with each principal component. The resulting values represent the coordinates of the data point in the low-dimensional space defined by the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection onto the principal components can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most important information about the data. By selecting a subset of the principal components that capture a large percentage of the total variance in the data, it is possible to represent the data in a lower-dimensional space, without losing too much information. The projected data can then be used for various purposes, such as data visualization, clustering, classification, or regression.\n",

    "Overall, projection is a key step in PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques, and it plays an important role in transforming the data into a lower-dimensional space, where it can be analyzed more efficiently and effectively."

    "One approach to choosing the optimal number of principal components is to use the scree plot, which shows the eigenvalues of the principal components in decreasing order. The point at which the eigenvalues start to level off is often used as a cutoff for the number of principal components to retain, as this indicates that the remaining components capture relatively little additional variation in the data.\n",
