    "Data encoding is the process of transforming data from one format to another in order to make it suitable for transmission or storage in a particular system or application. In data science, encoding is useful because it can help to ensure data compatibility and consistency across different systems, as well as facilitate data analysis and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of data encoding, such as character encoding, which is used to represent characters in a particular language or script, and numeric encoding, which is used to represent numerical values. Another common type of encoding used in data science is one-hot encoding, which is used to transform categorical data into a format that can be used in machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding works by creating a new binary feature for each possible category in the data, where the feature is set to 1 if the category is present and 0 otherwise. This can be useful in machine learning algorithms because it allows categorical data to be represented as numerical data, which can be more easily processed and analyzed.\n",

    "Nominal encoding is a type of encoding used in data science to convert categorical data into numerical data. In nominal encoding, each category or label is assigned a unique numerical value, without any particular order or hierarchy.\n",

    "Nominal encoding and one-hot encoding are both commonly used techniques for encoding categorical data in data science. The choice between the two techniques depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the machine learning problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "One situation where nominal encoding may be preferred over one-hot encoding is when the number of categories in the data is very large. One-hot encoding can result in a very high-dimensional feature space, which can be computationally expensive and may lead to overfitting in some machine learning models. In such cases, nominal encoding can provide a more efficient representation of the categorical data.\n",

If we use one-hot encoding, we would create a new binary feature for each level of education (e.g., high school, college, graduate degree).
