    "1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a technique that uses Eigen-Decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets. PCA finds the principal components of the data, which are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data. By projecting the data onto these principal components, PCA can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much of the original information as possible. PCA is widely used in data preprocessing and feature extraction in various machine learning applications.\n",

SVD is used in many machine learning applications, including data compression, image processing, and collaborative filtering. In particular, SVD is the core algorithm used in matrix factorization techniques, which are widely used in recommendation systems.\n",

    "3) Eigenfaces: Eigenfaces is a technique that uses Eigen-Decomposition to analyze and recognize faces. The basic idea is to represent faces as vectors in a high-dimensional space and then use PCA to find the principal components of the face data. These principal components can be used to construct \"eigenfaces,\" which are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the face data. Eigenfaces can then be used to recognize new faces by projecting them onto the eigenface space and comparing them to the existing eigenfaces.\n",
